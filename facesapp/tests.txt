tests to do:
1. simulating user who clicks on image - to ensure it is tracked properly with micro
2. simulating user who hovers on an image
3. when user clicks on image, assign an image attribute in the html
- when it is clicked, check that the attribute assigned to this image has been clicked (sent to micro)



in onClick for django can make a send to micro
- check assertEqual in nightwatch (check for diff asserts, mayb one with JS variables or elements)
can change server code to be use in nightwatch

can we only communicate through html elements or from java script variables also?
If we can communicate through variables then i could use the django server to set a binary variable like snowplow request sent
check if this variable is set to true in nightwatch
